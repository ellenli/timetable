# The Timetable Generator

This repo holds unpublished frontend developments for [The Timetable Generator](https://www.timetablegenerator.io/). The generator helps university students plan out their courses and schedules for the school year.

For the latest (experimental) frontend, visit http://ellen.li/timetable.

For earlier days, check out [my timetable-archive repo](https://github.com/ellenli/timetable-archive).

Thanks for dropping by.
